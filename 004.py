# Largest palindrome product
# Problem 4
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made
# from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

def isPalindrome(string):
    """Returns boolean value"""
    # string is zero or one char? -- return yes
    # is first char same as last? -- strip first, last, call isPalindrome on
    # stripped string
    # return no
